# WebShopApps MatrixRate

## Credits

This extension borrows heavily from the Tablerate capability in Magento2.  In order to keep codebase as bug-free and
conformant as possible the tablerate code is used in preference to writing from scratch.  This hopefully also
allows for easier understanding by users.

We would like to acknowledge and thank the Magento 2 Development team for making their codebase open for such use.
